# Security Threat Model: Monocle Browser Extension

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive security assessment of the Monocle browser extension from a threat modeling perspective. The analysis examines potential attack vectors, evaluates existing security controls, and provides recommendations for maintaining strong security posture.

**Overall Security Assessment: GOOD**
- Well-architected permission model with minimal initial footprint
- Strong isolation mechanisms using shadow DOM
- Proper message passing validation
- Good cross-browser compatibility considerations

## Architecture Overview

Monocle is a browser extension with the following key components:
- **Background Script**: Service worker handling command execution and browser API access
- **Content Script**: Injected into all pages with shadow DOM isolation
- **New Tab Page**: Dedicated command palette interface
- **Dual-mode architecture**: Both overlay and standalone modes

## Threat Model Analysis

### 1. Permission-Based Attack Surface

#### Current Implementation
- **Initial permissions**: `activeTab`, `storage` (minimal footprint)
- **Optional permissions**: `bookmarks`, `browsingData`, `cookies`, `contextualIdentities`, `downloads`, `history`, `sessions`, `tabs`
- **On-demand permission requests**: User-initiated through permission action menu

#### Security Strengths ‚úÖ
- **Least privilege principle**: Only requests permissions when needed
- **User-controlled escalation**: All optional permissions require explicit user consent
- **Granular permissions**: Users can grant specific capabilities without over-permissioning
- **No host permissions**: Extension doesn't request access to specific websites beyond activeTab

#### Potential Threats ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Social engineering**: Malicious updates could trick users into granting unnecessary permissions
- **Permission creep**: Future development might accumulate unnecessary permissions
- **Missing permission validation**: Commands should verify permissions before execution

#### Recommendations üîß
1. **Add runtime permission validation** in command execution flow
2. **Implement permission audit logging** for security monitoring
3. **Consider permission usage analytics** to identify unnecessary permissions over time

### 2. Content Script Injection Security

#### Current Implementation
- **Injection scope**: `<all_urls>` with content script on every page
- **Isolation**: Closed shadow DOM with React app
- **CSP isolation**: Styles fetched from extension resources

#### Security Strengths ‚úÖ
- **Shadow DOM isolation**: Prevents page JavaScript from accessing extension UI
- **Closed shadow mode**: No external access to shadow root
- **Resource isolation**: CSS and scripts loaded from extension context
- **No page script interaction**: Extension operates independently of page scripts

#### Potential Threats ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Page enumeration**: Presence reveals extension installation to malicious sites
- **DOM manipulation**: Malicious pages could attempt to detect or interfere with extension DOM
- **Resource timing attacks**: Page scripts might infer extension state through timing

#### Recommendations üîß
1. **Consider opt-in activation**: Allow users to disable content script on sensitive sites
2. **Add anti-fingerprinting measures**: Randomize DOM IDs and class names
3. **Monitor for interference**: Log and handle attempts to manipulate extension DOM

### 3. Message Passing Security

#### Current Implementation
- **Type-safe messaging**: Uses TypeScript pattern matching for message validation
- **Background-only command execution**: All browser API calls centralized
- **Structured message types**: Defined message schema with validation

#### Security Strengths ‚úÖ
- **Message validation**: Type checking prevents malformed messages
- **Centralized execution**: Background script acts as security boundary
- **No direct API access**: Content scripts can't directly call browser APIs
- **Context passing**: Browser context included in all messages for validation

#### Potential Threats ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Message injection**: Malicious pages might attempt to send crafted messages
- **Context spoofing**: Attacks might try to forge browser context information
- **Command injection**: Malicious form values could be injected into commands

#### Recommendations üîß
1. **Add message origin validation**: Verify messages come from extension contexts
2. **Sanitize user inputs**: Validate and sanitize all form values before processing
3. **Implement rate limiting**: Prevent message flooding attacks

### 4. Command Execution Privilege Model

#### Current Implementation
- **Command types**: RunCommand, ParentCommand, UICommand with different privileges
- **Browser API abstraction**: Centralized browser API calls through utility layer
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Handles Chrome/Firefox API differences

#### Security Strengths ‚úÖ
- **Centralized API access**: All browser API calls go through background script
- **Permission checking**: Commands declare required permissions
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure modes for missing permissions
- **Input validation**: Form values processed through structured UI definitions

#### Potential Threats ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Privilege escalation**: Commands might exceed their declared permission requirements
- **API abuse**: Malicious commands could misuse browser APIs
- **Command injection**: Dynamic command generation might introduce vulnerabilities
- **URL validation bypass**: Commands handling URLs might be exploited

#### Recommendations üîß
1. **Add permission enforcement**: Runtime validation that commands only use declared permissions
2. **Implement URL whitelisting**: Validate URLs in bookmark/navigation commands
3. **Add command auditing**: Log sensitive command executions for monitoring
4. **Sanitize dynamic content**: Validate all user-generated command content

### 5. Data Storage Security

#### Current Implementation
- **Storage location**: `chrome.storage.local` for settings and state
- **Storage key**: `monocle-settings` namespace
- **Data types**: Settings, permissions, usage statistics, keybindings

#### Security Strengths ‚úÖ
- **Browser storage API**: Uses secure browser storage instead of localStorage
- **Namespaced keys**: Prevents conflicts with other extensions
- **Type-safe storage**: TypeScript interfaces for stored data
- **Cross-tab synchronization**: Consistent state across extension instances

#### Potential Threats ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Data exposure**: Other extensions with storage permission could access data
- **Sensitive data storage**: Extension might accidentally store sensitive information
- **Storage corruption**: Malicious extensions might corrupt stored settings
- **Privacy leakage**: Usage statistics might reveal user behavior

#### Recommendations üîß
1. **Encrypt sensitive data**: Consider encrypting API keys and sensitive settings
2. **Add storage validation**: Verify integrity of loaded settings
3. **Implement data minimization**: Only store necessary user data
4. **Add storage access logging**: Monitor for unusual storage access patterns

### 6. Cross-Browser Security Implications

#### Current Implementation
- **Browser detection**: `isFirefox` flag based on extension URL protocol
- **API abstraction**: `callBrowserAPI` wrapper for Chrome/Firefox differences
- **Feature detection**: Graceful handling of browser-specific features

#### Security Strengths ‚úÖ
- **Consistent security model**: Same security controls across browsers
- **Feature degradation**: Missing permissions/features handled gracefully
- **Browser-specific validation**: Different API patterns handled correctly

#### Potential Threats ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Browser detection bypass**: Spoofed browser detection might cause API confusion
- **Permission model differences**: Chrome/Firefox permission differences might introduce gaps
- **API inconsistencies**: Browser-specific bugs might be exploited

#### Recommendations üîß
1. **Strengthen browser detection**: Use multiple detection methods
2. **Audit permission differences**: Ensure security model works consistently across browsers
3. **Add browser-specific testing**: Security testing on both Chrome and Firefox

## Additional Findings (Code Review)

The following concrete findings are based on a deeper review of the codebase and current browser extension security practices. They complement the analysis above with actionable, file-specific recommendations.

### A. Permission Gaps in Tab-Management Commands

- Several commands use `tabs.query`, `tabs.remove`, or window/tab focus APIs without declaring the `tabs` optional permission in their command definitions. This can lead to runtime failures and bypass of the intended UI permission gating (which relies on declared `permissions` per command).
- Examples using tab enumeration or manipulation without `permissions: ["tabs"]`:
  - background/commands/browser/openTabs.ts:1
  - background/commands/browser/gotoTab.ts:1
  - background/commands/browser/closeTabsToLeft.ts:1
  - background/commands/browser/closeTabsToRight.ts:1
  - background/commands/browser/closeOtherTabs.ts:1
  - background/commands/browser/moveCurrentTabToANewWindow.ts:1
  - background/commands/browser/moveCurrentTabToPopupWindow.ts:1

Recommendations:
- Add `permissions: ["tabs"]` to the above commands and any others that call `queryTabs`, `removeTab`, `updateTab` on non-active tabs, or enumerate tabs across windows.
- In addition, enforce permission checks in background execution (see section C) so even if a UI path forgets to gate, the background will refuse to run privileged commands without the corresponding permission.

### B. Message Origin Validation Status

- Current implementation already validates sender origin: `background/utils/runtime.ts` rejects external extension messages and direct web page messages by comparing `sender.id` to the extension `runtime.id` and checking `sender.url`.
- This addresses the previous recommendation to add origin validation.

Recommendations:
- Keep this logic and add a small unit/integration test to prevent regressions.
- Log rejected senders at a throttled rate to avoid noise during high message volumes.

### C. Background Runtime Permission Enforcement

- Today, permission gating largely happens in the UI (`usePermissionsGranted` + `PermissionActions`). Background execution paths (e.g., `execute-command`) don‚Äôt re-check permissions at runtime.

Recommendations:
- Before executing a command in `background/messages/executeCommand.ts:1` and `background/messages/executeKeybinding.ts:1`, resolve the target command, read its `permissions` array, and verify with `chrome.permissions.contains`/`browser.permissions.contains`. If missing, return a structured error (e.g., `{ error: "Missing permission: tabs" }`) so the UI can prompt to grant.
- Consider a helper in `background/utils/permissions.ts` to centralize these checks and keep the code clean.

### D. Message Schema Validation (Runtime)

- The code relies on TypeScript and `ts-pattern`, which are compile-time aids. There‚Äôs no runtime schema validation of message payloads.

Recommendations:
- Add lightweight runtime validation (e.g., Zod or superstruct) in `background/messages/index.ts:1` or per-handler wrappers in `background/utils/messages.ts:1`. Validate `type`, required fields, and basic string bounds (IDs, URLs) to harden against malformed inputs from compromised contexts.

### E. Content Security Policy for Extension Pages

- Manifest currently doesn‚Äôt specify `content_security_policy.extension_pages`. A restrictive CSP for extension pages reduces risk from future regressions.

Recommendations:
- Add to `manifest.json:1`:
  - `"content_security_policy": { "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'" }`
- If using external APIs from extension pages/service worker (Unsplash), consider also specifying `connect-src` if needed by the build tooling. Keep it as tight as possible.

### F. Host Permissions for External API Calls (Unsplash)

- The background fetches from `https://api.unsplash.com/...` in `background/messages/getUnsplashBackground.ts:1`.

Recommendations:
- Add `"host_permissions": ["https://api.unsplash.com/*"]` to `manifest.json:1` for clarity and future-proofing across browsers.
- Keep API keys out of the repo and wire via CI secrets (already noted in SECURITY_REVIEW.md).

### G. Favicon Privacy Leakage

- `background/utils/favicon.ts:1` uses Google‚Äôs favicon service (`https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?...`). This leaks visited domains for bookmarks/history to Google when rendering icons.

Recommendations:
- Prefer browser-native favicons when available (e.g., `tab.favIconUrl`).
- For bookmarks/history, consider:
  - `chrome://favicon/<url>` in Chromium (works without external calls), and a Firefox-safe fallback.
  - Or a privacy mode toggle to disable remote favicon fetching entirely.

### H. URL Handling and Encoding

- Some commands interpolate user-provided values directly into URLs (e.g., `background/commands/tools/googleSearch.ts:1`).

Recommendations:
- Encode query parameters with `encodeURIComponent` and validate URL schemes if any command accepts raw URLs.

### I. Broadcast Toasts and Rate Limiting

- `background/messages/showToast.ts:1` broadcasts to all tabs. While convenient, it can be noisy under repeated triggers.

Recommendations:
- Consider scoping to the active tab by default, with an explicit ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù variant when needed.
- Add simple rate limiting/debouncing to avoid UI spam.

### J. Documentation Updates

- Update the threat model to reflect that sender origin validation is implemented and to capture the permission declaration gaps in tab-management commands.

---

## Summary of New Recommendations

- Add missing `permissions: ["tabs"]` to tab-management commands and re-check in background before execution.
- Keep and test sender origin validation; add runtime schema validation for messages.
- Add CSP for extension pages; add Unsplash host permissions.
- Replace Google favicon service with privacy-preserving alternatives or add a privacy toggle.
- Encode user-provided URL parts and consider rate limiting for broadcast toasts.
